\chapter{Project Plan}

\section{Extensions}

Should the objectives listed in section \ref{section:objectives} be completed before the end of the project and there is enough time remaining, I have created a list of extensions that I would like to implement into the application.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Ext \arabic*}]
  \item Add the ability for users to add each other as friends within the app
  \item A recent activity feed could be added to show users what walks their friends have been on recently
  \item The user should be able to take photos during a walk and then publish these photos to their profile along with the walk
\end{enumerate}
