\section{Requirements} \label{section:requirements}

Based on the broad objectives from Section \ref{section:objectives} and the background research conducted in Chapter \ref{chapter:background}, a detailed list of technical requirements was created.

% add paragraph here or after requirements as to why you chose to do each one

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Req \arabic*}]
    \item Build a fully functioning iOS application with a simple design and an easy to use user interface.
    \item Allow the user to track the routes of the walks they go on, as well as provide statistics about the walk such as distance travelled and calories burned.
    \item During a walk, the application should display certain points of interest on a map near the user's current location.
    \item Each user should be able to register an account within the application and publish their tracked walks to their profile if they wish.
    \item The application should display a list of the most popular walks in the area around you, with each walk containing statistics about how many times it has been walked and which user has walked it the most.
    \item Users should be able to invite other users to go on a walk together and schedule this walk for a point in the future.
    \item The application should contain some level of gamification - each user will have a score on their profile based on how far they have walked in total, how many walks they have been on and how often they go for a walk.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Extensions}

Should the requirements listed in Section \ref{section:requirements} be completed before the end of the project and there is enough time remaining, I have created a list of extensions that I would like to implement to extend the app's functionality.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Ext \arabic*}]
  \item Add the ability for users to add each other as friends within the app.
  \item A recent activity feed could be added to show users what walks their friends have been on recently.
  \item The user should be able to take photos during a walk and then publish these photos to their profile along with the walk.
  \item Extend the gamification aspect of the app - users could set each other challenges to encourage a higher level of fitness.
  \item Allow users to post a public invitation to a walk for any other user to join them.
  \item Implement a list of set walks nearby that the user could go on -- the London Loop for example.
\end{enumerate}
