% Background - what is the problem?
% Why is the problem difficult to solve
% The idea which this project is solving

In this day and age, it is extremely important to keep fit. With the rapid development in technology in the recent years, people are more inclined to stay inside looking at a screen rather than go outside and exercise.

%The increased use of technology is shown to...

The difficulty in trying to encourage people to exercise lies in the ability to engage the user and find something that they enjoy to do. If exercising is seen as something that the user enjoys, it then becomes a pleasure to do rather than a burden.

A way to create enjoyment 

A great way to encourage people to exercise and keep fit is to aid them into discovering new places in the area around them. 

\section{Objectives} \label{section:objectives}

The aim of this project is to produce a working application that encourages people to walk more and helps discover new places in the world. The main objectives for the project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Obj \arabic*}]
    \item Build a fully functioning iOS application with a simple design and an easy to use user interface.
    \item Allow the user to track the routes of the walks they go on, as well as provide statistics about the walk such as distance travelled and calories burned.
    \item During a walk, the application will display certain points of interest on a map near the user's current location.
    \item Each user should be able to register an account within the application and publish their tracked walks to their profile if they wish.
    \item The application should display a list of the most popular walks in the area around you, with each walk containing statistics about how many times it has been walked and which user has walked it the most.
    \item Users should be able to invite other users to go on a walk together and schedule this walk for a point in the future.
    \item The application should contain some level of gamification - each user will have a score on their profile based on how far they have walked in total, how many walks they have been on and how often they go for a walk.
\end{enumerate}
