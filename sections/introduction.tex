\section{Objectives} \label{section:objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Record walks (not necessarily on the London Loop)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During walks, information is shown about points of interest around you
        \item Take photos during walks
    \end{itemize}
    \item Each user has a profile which walks can be published to
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Walks can be marked as public or private, with public walks visible on your profile to other users
        \item Gamification aspect – each user has a score on their profile based on how far they’ve walked + other factors e.g. more points if you walk everyday for a week
    \end{itemize}
    \item Leaderboard of the most popular walks in your area
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each walk would show you stats about it e.g. length of walk, which user has walked it the most, etc.
        \item Users can then go on these walks by following directions
    \end{itemize}
    \item Users can invite other users to go on a walk with them
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bonus points for score for walking together?

The aim of the project is to produce a working application that encourages people to walk more and helps discover places in the world. The main objectives for the project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Obj \arabic*}]
    \item Build a fully functioning iOS application with a simple design and an easy to use user interface
    \item The application should allow the user to track the routes of the walks they go on, as well as provide statistics about the walk such as distance travelled and calories burned
    \item During a walk, the application will display certain points of interest on a map near the user's current location
    \item Each user should be able to register an account within the application and publish their tracked walks to their profile
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
