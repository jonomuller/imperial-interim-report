% Background - what is the problem?
% Why is the problem difficult to solve
% The idea which this project is solving

In this day and age, it is extremely important to keep fit. With the rapid development in technology in the recent years, people are more inclined to stay inside looking at a screen rather than go outside and exercise. The main demographic seeing an increase in the use of smartphones and computers are teenagers and young men. The increased day-to-day use of technology is shown to have an impact on the number of obese adolescents in the UK \cite{Kautiainen2005}, which can increase the chances of people developing serious illnesses including diabetes \cite{Lazar2005}. It is therefore of great significance to provide a means of exercising that helps people, especially adolescents, keep healthy.

The difficulty in trying to encourage people to exercise lies in the ability to engage the user and find something that they enjoy to do. If exercising is seen as something that you enjoy, it then becomes a pleasure to do rather than a burden. Gamification plays an important part in helping people exercise, and has been used in lots of fitness apps available on the iOS App Store already \cite{Lister2014}. The range in which companies have implemented gamification into their fitness applications ranges from score-based system where users can compete against their friends to a complete game that allows the user to explore the world around them. An example of the latter is the popular mobile game Pok\'{e}mon Go where you have to walk around and capture virtual `creatures' that are scattered around in the real world.

%A way to create enjoyment

A great way to encourage people to exercise and keep fit is to aid them into discovering new places in the area around them.

\section{Objectives} \label{section:objectives}

The aim of this project is to produce a working application that encourages people to walk more and helps discover new places in the world. The main objectives for the project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Obj \arabic*}]
    \item Build a fully functioning iOS application with a simple design and an easy to use user interface.
    \item Allow the user to track the routes of the walks they go on, as well as provide statistics about the walk such as distance travelled and calories burned.
    \item During a walk, the application should display certain points of interest on a map near the user's current location.
    \item Each user should be able to register an account within the application and publish their tracked walks to their profile if they wish.
    \item The application should display a list of the most popular walks in the area around you, with each walk containing statistics about how many times it has been walked and which user has walked it the most.
    \item Users should be able to invite other users to go on a walk together and schedule this walk for a point in the future.
    \item The application should contain some level of gamification - each user will have a score on their profile based on how far they have walked in total, how many walks they have been on and how often they go for a walk.
\end{enumerate}
