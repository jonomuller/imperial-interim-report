\chapter{Background}

\section{Gamification}

% research how gamification has been used in applications, not just walking apps
% discuss how well each implementation has worked

\section{Existing Applications}

% overview

There are a number of existing applications available that attempt to solve the problem posed by this project. These range from complete fitness applications to various navigation applications, which although may not be completely relevant to this project, they do provide some similar features that will be useful to research. Table \ref{table:existing-walking-apps} shows what features each of the existing applications related to this project have implemented. The maximum score for the feature category is displayed in brackets.

% maybe don't include this
%Although existing navigation apps do not contain any features relating to tracking walks, they do provide information about how journeys and places are displayed on a map.


% not sure whether to include this in background or design?
