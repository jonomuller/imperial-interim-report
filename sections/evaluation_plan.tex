\chapter{Evaluation Plan} \label{chapter:evaluation-plan}

\section{Testing}

The testing evaluation of the project should be conducted throughout the project as the application is being implemented. The main aspects of the project that need to be tested and evaluated are listed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Design of application:} to test the design of the application, a design survey will conducted during the design phase of the project asking users what they think of initial design mockups of the application. Another survey will then be conducted near the end of the project to assess whether the design of the application I have made is appealing to the user -- along with anything I need to change.
  \item \textbf{Ease of use of application:} the ease of use of the application will be evaluated through user testing. Family and friends who test the application will give me feedback on how easy the application is to use, as well as what features are implemented well. Once I have implemented more features into the application, I will be able to beta test the app with users. At this stage I could also conduct hallway testing where I give the app to stranger and they give me their initial feedback.
  \item \textbf{Reflect on objectives:} once the project is nearing completion, I will look back and assess if have accomplished my original objectives listed in Section \ref{section:objectives} and the requirements in Section \ref{section:requirements}, or explain why I have not.
  \item \textbf{Database stress testing:} one of the more technical aspects to test is the database. I will need to stress test the database to prevent any performance issues when providing data for the user. I will also test whether the user's login details are stored securely.
  \item \textbf{Unit testing:} unit testing will be conducted on the iOS application to make sure there are no errors in areas including storing data to the phone's internal database and displaying map data on screen.
%  \item \textbf{General user testing:}
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Timeline}

Following on from the project timeline in Section \ref{section:project-timeline}, I have created a detailed timeline listing each of the testing and evaluation tasks that should be completed during the project. The timeline can be seen in Table \ref{table:evaluation-plan}.

\begin{table}[hbt]

  \begin{tabular}{|l|| *{17}{c|}}

A lot of technical testing will be done throughout the project.
